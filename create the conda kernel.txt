process for new project creation
create the conda new project environment with the new kernel and install tensorflow gpu (done)(https://www.techentice.com/how-to-make-jupyter-notebook-to-run-on-gpu/)
install the super gradients 
install the pytorch gpu respective to the already existing cuda and cudnn libraries from the website






>> to work with python in pycahrm like normal procedure is
1) open anaconda navigator
2) select the project env
3) launch pycharm (now pycharm is inside the anaconda packages , note:: ## if you open pycharm from outside the anaconda navigator like directly, then the files may not have the packages that were installed in that env)



note:
1) never install super_gradients with 3.0.1 version because it is not compatible with the torch >2.0.1+cu118
*********
********* 2) if torch version is down for unknown reason then delete that torch and reinstall it

3) the requirements.txt file that was created just before writing the streamlit_web code, to install the streamlit application in the terminal ,not required to run everytime (just during the first is enough)
>i.e pip install -r requirements.txt
